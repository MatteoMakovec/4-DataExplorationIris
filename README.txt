In the first part of the notebook, as always, we perform some data exploration.
This time, the data exploration concentrate its effort mostly on the data visualization (therefore the professor shows us different way to plot data).

In the second part of the notebook we perform the Principal Component Analysis.
We apply PCA to project the four original dimensions into a two dimensional space.
[Be aware by the fact that PCA is affected by attribute scale so we normalize all the attributes by eliminating the mean and scaling to unit variance]
What can we infer from the results that we have obtained?

In conclusion, we have discussed about the t-SNE. This acronym stands for t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding and indicates an algorithm used as PCA to perform dimensionality reduction, but this time in non-linear cases
Again, what can we infer form the results?
